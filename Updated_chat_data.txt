05/02/2020, 12:41 pm - Rohit: i follow text book je duh, i need to study sorting lu
05/02/2020, 12:41 pm - Rohit: gimme time to coiver all 1 round lu
05/02/2020, 12:42 pm - Ed: Haha
05/02/2020, 12:42 pm - Ed: Hashing is easy
05/02/2020, 12:42 pm - Ed: Sorting take time

05/02/2020, 12:57 pm - Rohit: or recursice sequnetial search code
05/02/2020, 12:57 pm - Rohit: big marks
05/02/2020, 12:57 pm - Rohit: algorith is in pseudocode
05/02/2020, 12:58 pm - Ed: Nono

05/02/2020, 1:01 pm - Ed: But I will choose to write in algo
05/02/2020, 1:01 pm - Ed: Cos Ms teach already
05/02/2020, 1:01 pm - Rohit: pseudocde is how algo is written lol
05/02/2020, 1:01 pm - Rohit: u google that boss

05/02/2020, 2:14 pm - Rohit: <Media omitted>
05/02/2020, 2:14 pm - Rohit: teacher got say about algo being able to track
05/02/2020, 2:14 pm - Rohit: see the note
05/02/2020, 2:14 pm - Rohit: that why the highlight is the pass counter
05/02/2020, 2:15 pm - Rohit: see pass 3 and 4
05/02/2020, 2:15 pm - Rohit: already sorted
05/02/2020, 2:15 pm - Rohit: but is still considered as a pass
05/02/2020, 2:15 pm - Ed: Why this buddle sort so different from Ms teach one..
05/02/2020, 2:16 pm - Ed: Bubble*

05/02/2020, 3:21 pm - Ed: Must follow liek yours
05/02/2020, 3:21 pm - Rohit: Coding or algo, yes can the question say dy
05/02/2020, 3:23 pm - Ed: In qick sort do we need to show the number of pass?
05/02/2020, 3:24 pm - Rohit: X sure, maybe just simple numbering will do at the side, I research on9 on quick sort now some questions I stuck
05/02/2020, 3:25 pm - Rohit: The method not adapting to the question, especially 2019 Jan
05/02/2020, 3:25 pm - Ed: i have the answer

05/02/2020, 5:09 pm - Ed: I GB cannot be hash
05/02/2020, 5:09 pm - Ed: And in algorithm we say we hash four number behide
05/02/2020, 5:10 pm - Ed: The GB remains unmove
05/02/2020, 5:10 pm - Ed: That what I understand
05/02/2020, 5:11 pm - Ed: @60197773622

05/02/2020, 5:16 pm - Rohit: almost done all search and sort pyq, trying to send here by 6. Then i will proceed to hashing and later that tree
05/02/2020, 5:16 pm - Rohit: i do later let u know GB or nmot hahaha
05/02/2020, 5:16 pm - Ed: Kk Bro
05/02/2020, 5:17 pm - Rohit: gb at wher eha?

05/02/2020, 5:41 pm - Rohit: i just refer the lecture slide pyq one
05/02/2020, 5:44 pm - Rohit: i did not write that
05/02/2020, 5:45 pm - Rohit: yea

05/02/2020, 5:47 pm - Rohit: Quick sort I x sure la, I just follow teacher method and always obey the conditions at every pass. Also I not very sure like teacher do only have 1 time pass the pivot directly to the middle
05/02/2020, 5:48 pm - Rohit: Our question pass the pivot at the end so I just adapted the same formula and it works
05/02/2020, 5:48 pm - Rohit: I Google online have other ways, but scare not applicable Bec the rubrics don't have that method
05/02/2020, 5:48 pm - Rohit: So I stick to her method
05/02/2020, 5:49 pm - Rohit: umm is binary tree chapter alot?
05/02/2020, 5:49 pm - Rohit: bcuz i dik to start hash or tree lu?
05/02/2020, 5:49 pm - Ed: Not much
05/02/2020, 5:49 pm - Rohit: ok i go with hash then
05/02/2020, 5:50 pm - Ed: I stack at chapter 6
05/02/2020, 5:50 pm - Ed: I dunno how to trace damn
05/02/2020, 5:50 pm - Rohit: oh bruh u see the lecture lside i snap above

05/02/2020, 6:17 pm - Ed: The hashing ah
05/02/2020, 6:17 pm - Ed: I trying to rewrite everything
05/02/2020, 6:17 pm - Rohit: yea
05/02/2020, 6:17 pm - Ed: Cos too messy

05/02/2020, 6:19 pm - Rohit: 2feb what year
05/02/2020, 6:19 pm - Ed: 2017
05/02/2020, 6:20 pm - Rohit: Rem3 the k+n^2 damn important under quadratic ah
05/02/2020, 6:21 pm - Ed: Remember *
05/02/2020, 6:21 pm - Ed: Yup
05/02/2020, 6:22 pm - Ed: Remember once have collision then 1^2
05/02/2020, 6:22 pm - Ed: The second time is 2^2
05/02/2020, 6:22 pm - Ed: K is the number
05/02/2020, 6:23 pm - Ed: http://eprints.tarc.edu.my/12619/1/BACS2063.pdf
05/02/2020, 6:23 pm - Ed: @60183560200 this have the chain also
05/02/2020, 6:24 pm - Ed: I doing 2 may
05/02/2020, 6:25 pm - Rohit: bruh include year also haha i legit lost which year if u dun say
05/02/2020, 6:25 pm - Ed: Kk sorry
05/02/2020, 6:27 pm - Ed: 7 may 2019 - chain hashing

05/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Rohit: eh my bubble
05/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Rohit: and inmsertion
05/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Rohit: follow lecture note 100% oh
05/02/2020, 7:05 pm - Ed: i want to makan also ahha
05/02/2020, 7:06 pm - Ed: later close alredy haha
05/02/2020, 7:08 pm - Rohit: woah
05/02/2020, 7:08 pm - Rohit: lecture lain
05/02/2020, 7:08 pm - Rohit: notes lain
05/02/2020, 7:11 pm - Rohit: u see additional notes tuesday
05/02/2020, 7:11 pm - Rohit: sudden;y same as me and lecture notes
05/02/2020, 7:11 pm - Rohit: additional notes thursday lain pulak
05/02/2020, 7:13 pm - Rohit: tuesday and lecture slide did
05/02/2020, 7:13 pm - Rohit: single digit mulyiple swqap
05/02/2020, 7:13 pm - Rohit: then some place do multiple digit multiple/single swaps
05/02/2020, 7:14 pm - Rohit: both also get 6 pass
05/02/2020, 7:14 pm - Rohit: lert it go lol
05/02/2020, 7:14 pm - Rohit: diff methods i presume
05/02/2020, 7:17 pm - Rohit: any of ur pyq
05/02/2020, 7:17 pm - Rohit: have collision?
05/02/2020, 7:17 pm - Rohit: <Media omitted>
05/02/2020, 7:17 pm - Rohit: linear probing collision
05/02/2020, 7:47 pm - Rohit: ignore this
05/02/2020, 7:47 pm - Rohit: wrongly asked
05/02/2020, 7:47 pm - Rohit: having issue here
05/02/2020, 7:51 pm - Rohit: i meant like 2 may 2018 all key x clash, they all individual
05/02/2020, 7:51 pm - Rohit: didint had to i+1 until find vacant spot
05/02/2020, 7:51 pm - Rohit: what is key ah
05/02/2020, 7:51 pm - Rohit: is it the key or index
05/02/2020, 7:52 pm - Rohit: ok nmoted
05/02/2020, 7:53 pm - Ed: Ya
05/02/2020, 7:53 pm - Rohit: my bad wrongly see
05/02/2020, 7:54 pm - Ed: So is like first collision you can use k+1^2
Then after the second one is k+2^2 
After that is k+3^2 the third collision
05/02/2020, 7:54 pm - Ed: Remember
05/02/2020, 7:54 pm - Ed: The remainder is the index number
05/02/2020, 7:54 pm - Rohit: k is what
05/02/2020, 7:54 pm - Rohit: the index number?
05/02/2020, 7:54 pm - Rohit: or key boss
05/02/2020, 7:55 pm - Rohit: lets say k is 5
05/02/2020, 7:55 pm - Rohit: this is 3rd colision
05/02/2020, 7:55 pm - Rohit: sk 5 + 3^2
05/02/2020, 7:56 pm - Rohit: k 5 + 3^2 = the new index to put the value
05/02/2020, 7:56 pm - Ed: Key Bro
05/02/2020, 7:56 pm - Rohit: oh lol okok noted
05/02/2020, 7:56 pm - Ed: Yup and divide on the size
05/02/2020, 7:56 pm - Ed: Get the reminder you will have the index number
05/02/2020, 7:56 pm - Rohit: ah thats where i went wrong
05/02/2020, 7:56 pm - Rohit: to do the modulus again
05/02/2020, 7:56 pm - Ed: Yup
05/02/2020, 7:56 pm - Ed: That easy Bro
05/02/2020, 7:57 pm - Ed: I still trying on chpater 6 damn
05/02/2020, 7:57 pm - Rohit: cry la, hmm need fast do tree also if i have time still i call u latenight if u havent sleep
05/02/2020, 7:57 pm - Rohit: if u still cant la
05/02/2020, 7:57 pm - Rohit: i try settle until tree lu
05/02/2020, 7:59 pm - Rohit: <Media omitted>
05/02/2020, 7:59 pm - Rohit: lets say
05/02/2020, 7:59 pm - Rohit: the 10
05/02/2020, 7:59 pm - Rohit: it want to enter at 3
05/02/2020, 7:59 pm - Rohit: but 3 is filled after k+1
05/02/2020, 7:59 pm - Rohit: does the same formula pply to key 10
05/02/2020, 8:01 pm - Rohit: so basically the formula is saved separately for each unqiue index
05/02/2020, 8:01 pm - Rohit: like if we begin collison at index 2
05/02/2020, 8:01 pm - Ed: Yup
05/02/2020, 8:01 pm - Ed: All will start again
05/02/2020, 8:01 pm - Rohit: so all index 2 colisions will carry on with the k+n^2
05/02/2020, 8:01 pm - Rohit: so all index 3 colisions will carry on with the k+n^2
05/02/2020, 8:01 pm - Rohit: etc
05/02/2020, 8:01 pm - Ed: As long the collision is in different key value will restore
05/02/2020, 8:02 pm - Ed: Correct
05/02/2020, 8:02 pm - Rohit: ok got it
05/02/2020, 8:02 pm - Ed: @60197773622
05/02/2020, 8:02 pm - Ed: You see 16
05/02/2020, 8:02 pm - Ed: Put in two ma
05/02/2020, 8:03 pm - Ed: That mean 16 +9 /7
05/02/2020, 8:03 pm - Ed: Get the reminder
05/02/2020, 8:03 pm - Rohit: woah what
05/02/2020, 8:04 pm - Ed: Sorry
05/02/2020, 8:04 pm - Ed: Is 16+2/7
05/02/2020, 8:04 pm - Ed: And get the reminder that mean 16 will be in index 6
05/02/2020, 8:04 pm - Rohit: what about 39
05/02/2020, 8:05 pm - Rohit: 6+2^2/7?
05/02/2020, 8:05 pm - Rohit: 1sr collision is k+1
05/02/2020, 8:05 pm - Rohit: 2nd is K+2^2
05/02/2020, 8:06 pm - Rohit: 6+2^2/7?
05/02/2020, 8:06 pm - Ed: Bro
05/02/2020, 8:06 pm - Ed: Why take 6
05/02/2020, 8:06 pm - Rohit: 16*
05/02/2020, 8:06 pm - Rohit: soryy
05/02/2020, 8:07 pm - Ed: Yes
05/02/2020, 8:07 pm - Rohit: what about the 39
05/02/2020, 8:07 pm - Rohit: what formula u use i testing my underastanidn based on ur answer
05/02/2020, 8:09 pm - Ed: Do this
05/02/2020, 8:09 pm - Ed: See your understanding
05/02/2020, 8:09 pm - Ed: If u can do np
05/02/2020, 8:09 pm - Ed: And this
05/02/2020, 8:09 pm - Rohit: u see ah 39 cannot put on 5
05/02/2020, 8:09 pm - Rohit: bcuz 5 has 26
05/02/2020, 8:10 pm - Ed: <Media omitted>
05/02/2020, 8:10 pm - Rohit: this is damn good question u know
05/02/2020, 8:10 pm - Rohit: yea gonna do awhile more
05/02/2020, 8:10 pm - Rohit: 39 lompat 2 kali
05/02/2020, 8:10 pm - Ed: Ya so you jump for space
05/02/2020, 8:10 pm - Ed: Cos is 2^2
05/02/2020, 8:10 pm - Rohit: i seeing the formula
05/02/2020, 8:11 pm - Rohit: now i see thru
05/02/2020, 8:11 pm - Rohit: the collions probe
05/02/2020, 8:11 pm - Rohit: is bnasded on the key
05/02/2020, 8:11 pm - Rohit: not index
05/02/2020, 8:12 pm - Rohit: number of times the key clash will decide the n
05/02/2020, 8:12 pm - Rohit: i trying to drill down the formula
05/02/2020, 8:12 pm - Rohit: i did it dy
05/02/2020, 8:12 pm - Rohit: thx
05/02/2020, 8:12 pm - Rohit: ‚ù§

06/02/2020, 6:14 pm - Rohit: Lecture 13 he did simple discussion sadly he used a application online couldn't take the answer, the answer above is part of it
06/02/2020, 6:15 pm - Rohit: There was more complex questions with good answer but before I snapped he padam
06/02/2020, 6:15 pm - Rohit: I ask Kampar dy they also dont have
06/02/2020, 6:16 pm - Rohit: I remembered who went that day it was the voting day also, was some fella at the front row but not our degree didn't got a chance to ask them

06/02/2020, 6:23 pm - Rohit: From 71 to 79 I think
06/02/2020, 6:23 pm - Rohit: Open textbook infront him
06/02/2020, 6:24 pm - Rohit: He ah don't understand passive English take note
06/02/2020, 6:24 pm - Ed: Gg
06/02/2020, 6:24 pm - Rohit: Also don't use sophisticated English terms to combine multiple words into 1

07/02/2020, 12:50 pm - Ed: just asking xD
07/02/2020, 12:50 pm - Rohit: his paper need to grind theory with industrial example
07/02/2020, 12:50 pm - Rohit: if u waste time thinking theory
07/02/2020, 12:50 pm - Rohit: u wont give proper example

28/04/2020, 12:36 pm - Ed: Firstly, the Lessig‚Äôs Four Modalities Analysis on the Autonomous driving is social. In the social side, it allows people to be not so worry about road accident that happen very frequent because of the artificial intelligence that are about to predict or calculate the accident automated braking or lane-changing like Telsa car that will happen and also the artificial intelligence are mature enough in . Moreover, it help the social to get from point A to point B faster because of the less traffic with the autonomous driving it will able to help all the vehicles and the driverless car connect to each other to find a optimum rote to get to the location rather than every car go on the same road .By doing this will benefits the social and more people will agree and use autonomous driving car.
	
	Furthermore, in the markets of autonomous driving company such as Waymo, Apple, Ford autonomous vehicles and Tesla are actually developing and producing autonomous vehicles.  The markets of autonomous car is going to hits  54.23 Billion dollar by 2026 and this creating more job opportunity for developer in software or data science student to involve. Moreover, it will also help to produce 6.9 Million unit of autonomous car by 2030 this will help the manufacturer car to have a new opportunity in the autonomous driving.

	In addition, the architecture of autonomous driving car is there. The technology is undergoes pre- mature state. Company like Tesla and Waymo are actually successful in develop autonomous driving car in level 3 where by for a fully function for autonomous driving or non-human interaction that is level 4. But the architecture of autonomous car is there such as in hardware and software.
Company like Waywo or Tesla are using radar sensor as hardware to have a good view on the distance forward in the condition like light, dark and all the weather condition. Moreover, using Ultrasonic to have a good measure of all the proximity conditions and recognize objects in all conditions that it is safe. In addition, they also build an mature artificial intelligence with a good neural network whereby the neural network able to make a quick decision.

	Last by least, the law of the autonomous driving that was proposes by Germany on January 25,2017. The proposes law was to have a black box on every autonomous car whether the vehicle is control or not been control by driving system. In addition, it will record all the vehicle requested by passages or the driver. Moreover, it also have law like if someone is injured in an accident due of the autonomous driving or malfunctioning in the car, the victim are allowed to recover 10 million.

Html, css, js =front end 
Backend use =node.js
Database =firebase
27/05/2020, 9:29 pm - Rohit: why not use jquery with ajax backen
27/05/2020, 9:29 pm - Rohit: that is a must in modern day programming
27/05/2020, 9:29 pm - Ed: This is easy start
27/05/2020, 9:29 pm - Rohit: i think u can even find why so online
27/05/2020, 9:29 pm - Rohit: oh okok

27/05/2020, 9:31 pm - Ed: Bootstrap

27/05/2020, 9:31 pm - Rohit: yea well personal chocie
27/05/2020, 9:31 pm - Rohit: so not bias haha
27/05/2020, 9:31 pm - Ed: Bootstrap, lavarel and the last is firebase
27/05/2020, 9:32 pm - Ed: üòÇ üòÇ
27/05/2020, 9:32 pm - Ed: That is thing
27/05/2020, 9:32 pm - Ed: üòÇ üòÇ
27/05/2020, 9:32 pm - Ed: I scare lioa
27/05/2020, 9:33 pm - Ed: Laravel have all the sandbox
27/05/2020, 9:33 pm - Ed: Bootstrap have css and html and json
27/05/2020, 9:33 pm - Ed: üòÇ üòÇ
27/05/2020, 9:33 pm - Ed: But in pun ada
27/05/2020, 9:39 pm - Ed: @60197773622 actually
27/05/2020, 9:39 pm - Ed: I can use bootstrap only right
27/05/2020, 9:39 pm - Ed: üòÇ üòÇ
27/05/2020, 9:39 pm - Ed: I feel it very limited in design only le no function
27/05/2020, 9:40 pm - Rohit: technically ah, bootstrap not mandatory just save alot of time in terms of user friendliness. Your focus should actually be in implementing APIs, using frameworks(this is technically for not u coding things from scratch)
27/05/2020, 9:41 pm - Rohit: u will still need to code functions on your own
27/05/2020, 9:41 pm - Rohit: either u ambik from packages that people did
27/05/2020, 9:41 pm - Rohit: or you take codes from githgub etc and custom code to tune to your function needs
27/05/2020, 9:41 pm - Rohit: framework is basically bootstrap in another category
27/05/2020, 9:42 pm - Ed: Laravel
27/05/2020, 9:42 pm - Ed: Have all the php functionality
27/05/2020, 9:43 pm - Rohit: yup just like how bootstrap has html and css
27/05/2020, 9:43 pm - Rohit: so framework is backend dy
27/05/2020, 9:43 pm - Rohit: and bootstrap can say front
27/05/2020, 9:43 pm - Ed: That is the thing
27/05/2020, 9:44 pm - Rohit: but ur functions is not in any of these
27/05/2020, 9:44 pm - Ed: Laravel and bootstrap together
27/05/2020, 9:44 pm - Ed: üòÇ Damn I never see before
27/05/2020, 9:44 pm - Rohit: bcuz ur functions might need APIs or ajax or etc
27/05/2020, 9:44 pm - Rohit: idk la nowadays framework very OP wan
27/05/2020, 9:44 pm - Rohit: like AIO type dy
27/05/2020, 9:44 pm - Rohit: but dont forget tho your functions ah
27/05/2020, 9:45 pm - Rohit: i highly doubt u can get in frameworks for your BP plan
27/05/2020, 9:45 pm - Rohit: imagine having a restoran that serves thru car bike dine in and take away
27/05/2020, 9:45 pm - Rohit: imagine all the processes for this u need to have
27/05/2020, 9:46 pm - Rohit: so will use framework to ease time bcuz u dont have to code simple php functions from scratch righjt
27/05/2020, 9:46 pm - Rohit: why so? technically so u can focus on bigger things
27/05/2020, 9:46 pm - Rohit: but idk la i did try use cakephp
27/05/2020, 9:47 pm - Rohit: and i saw that in this sem liaw teach use to hardocde what was in cakephp
27/05/2020, 9:47 pm - Rohit: this is my exp la

27/05/2020, 9:48 pm - Rohit: <Media omitted>
27/05/2020, 9:49 pm - Rohit: that liaw made us code from scratch
27/05/2020, 9:49 pm - Rohit: which u dont have to
27/05/2020, 9:49 pm - Rohit: bcuz its there in every framework
27/05/2020, 9:49 pm - Rohit: so try to see what each framework offers over seeing the internet voting which is the best la
27/05/2020, 9:49 pm - Rohit: but i took cakephp bcuz it was a good start since integration was a breeze
27/05/2020, 9:50 pm - Rohit: as u see here vs my web assg ah u dont see bp functions in framework. so i think u get the point la

15/07/2020, 1:43 pm - Ed: The reason why we started this research it is because of the recent trends on the rise of the industry 4.0 concept in all manufacturing sector. Because of this, it brings us the question on how really IOT help to optimize the manufacturing sector*(condition)*.We assume that manufacturing like Nvidia and Microsoft are already using IoT to optimise industry 4.0 and had their own research and development department on IoT *(Assumption)*

15/07/2020, 1:47 pm - Rohit: For a moment ah y'all forget about teacher words
15/07/2020, 1:47 pm - Rohit: And analyze the samples from Google
15/07/2020, 1:47 pm - Rohit: See you can identify the conditions in each and every abstract and then you will see the pattern
