# NLP-implementation-on-whastapp-chats-using-python
This notebook was built to analyze Whatsapp conversations using the steps below: 
* Step 1: Detecting {Date} and {Time} tokens
* Step 2: Detecting the {Author} token
* Step 3: Extracting and Combining tokens
* Step 4: Parsing the entire file and handling Multi-Line Messages 

For further steps, we need to perform Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Step 5: Performing EDA for analyzing chat data
* Step 6: Overall statistics of WhatsApp chat including Total number of messages, media messages(Omitted) &amp; Total number of URLs
* Step 7: Extracting basic statistics for each Author (user)
* Step 8: Word cloud of most used words in chat
* Step 9: Total number of messages sent by each user
* Step 10: Total messages sent on each day of the week
* Step 11: Most active author of the chat
* Step 12: Most active day in a week

In next steps, Time series analysis will be performed on chat data  
* Step 13: Time whenever the chat was highly active
* Step 14: Date on which the chat was highly active
* Step 15: Converting 12-hour formate to 24 hours will help us for better analysis
* Step 16: Most suitable hour of the day whenever there will be more chances of getting a response from user
